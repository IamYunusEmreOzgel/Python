This game is an example of a two-player game where players try to guess a number between 0
and 100 one by one. The game starts with the first player. The system generates a random
number and the first player tries to guess it. Until he finds it, his trials should be recorded to be
compared with his rival. While guessing the generated number the system will direct the player
to make him find. If the predicted number is less than the generated number, then the system
gives a feedback to make player to renew his prediction to come close to generated number.
When he completes the guessing section, he is asked whether he wants to go on or not. Then,
now it is the second playerâ€™s turn. The system generates another random number and she tries
to guess it. Until she finds it, her trials should be recorded too. When she finds the expected
random number, she is asked for her decision to go on or quit. By using their decision about
going on or quit, the program decides on the flow. If any of them do not have fun and do not
want to go on, the program should give an output for the current state. If the number of games
between these 2 players is between 0 and 5, then each win has 5 points. Loss and draw do not
affect obtained results. If the number of games is less than or equal to 5, then there is no need
to check for a tie break. There can be a draw, it is not a problem. If the number of games more
than 5, each win has 10 points. If the number of games is more than 5 and also even like 6, 8
and so on, then these players should be asked for a final match to give a chance for the one
who needs more points. This match brings 15 points. For odd numbers such as 7, 9 and so on,
no need to ask for an extra match
